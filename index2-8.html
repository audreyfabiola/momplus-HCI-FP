        Congratulations, you have reached the home stretch! You will soon be welcoming a 
        beautiful new member to your family. You may be feeling more tired and uncomfortable 
        in these last months, but you have a lot to look forward to!</div>
    <div class="text">

        <h2>How You're feeling</h2>
        Some of the same discomforts you had in your second trimester will continue. Plus, many women 
        find breathing difficult and notice they have to go to the bathroom even more often. This is 
        because the baby is getting bigger and it is putting more pressure on your organs. Don't worry, 
        your baby is fine and these problems will lessen once you give birth.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
        While no two pregnancies are the same, some symptoms you may experience during your third trimester include:<br><br>

        <li>Acid reflux (heartburn)</li>
        <li>Haemorrhoids</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Swelling in your fingers, face and ankles</li>
        <li>Breast tenderness</li>
        <li>Protruding belly button</li>
        <li>Difficulty sleeping</li>
        <br>
        <h2>Self Care</h2>
        Because your baby is reaching full term, you may feel more uncomfortable during your third trimester than 
        you did during your second. To manage some of the discomfort, try some of the below methods after checking 
        with your health-care provider first. Remember, choices should always be made based on your preferences and 
        what is available to you.<br><br>
        -> For heartburn, ask your health provider for advice on diet and lifestyle modifications. If these do not 
        help, antacid preparations can be used for troublesome symptoms.<br>
        -> For difficulty sleeping, try using a pillow to support your whole body or just specific areas that need it 
        to help ease tension while you rest.<br><br>
        Healthy foods and regular exercise are important during your third trimester and throughout your pregnancy. 
        Keep up with your regular exercise routine, but do not exhaust yourself. As a general rule, you should be 
        able to hold a conversation while working out. Always consult your health-care provider about exercise 
        during pregnancy. Continue eating a variety of foods to make sure that you are getting adequate energy, 
        protein, vitamins and minerals.
