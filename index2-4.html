        <h2>How You're feeling</h2>
        Every woman is different, but many expecting mothers feel better during the 
        second trimester than they did during the first. Hopefully, you will start 
        to notice that you are feeling less nauseous and fatigued.

        You will start to encounter some new changes like a growing belly and by 
        the time you enter your third trimester, you should start to feel your 
        little one move and kick!
        <br><br>
        <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
        While no two pregnancies are the same, some symptoms you may experience 
        during your second trimester include:<br><br>

        <li>Carpal tunnel syndrome â€” numbness, tingling or weakness in your hand</li>
        <li>A line on your skin running from your belly button to your pubic hairline</li>
        <li>Patches of darker skin on your face</li>
        <li>Lower back and pelvic pain</li>
        <li>Darkening areola</li>
        <li>Stretch marks along your breasts, abdomen, buttocks and thighs</li>
        <br>
        <h2>Self Care</h2>
        Though your symptoms should be easing up during the second trimester, 
        you will start to notice bigger changes in your body. To manage some of 
        the aches and pains that may come with these changes, try some of the 
        below methods after checking with your health-care provider first. 
        Remember, choices should always be made based on your preferences and 
        what is available to you.<br><br>
        
        For lower back and pelvic pain, regular exercise throughout pregnancy 
        is recommended. There are many different treatment options that can be 
        used as well, such as physiotherapy, support belts and acupuncture.
        For carpal tunnel syndrome, rest, ice and elevate your hand and wrist.
        For stretch marks, if you are going to use a cream, gel or lotion, make 
        sure to do so early on and to massage the product into the marks. 
        It is also important to use the chosen product every day for weeks in a row.
        Healthy foods and regular exercise are key for your second trimester 
        and throughout your pregnancy. Keep up with your regular exercise 
        routine, but do not exhaust yourself. As a general rule, you should 
        be able to hold a conversation while working out. Always consult your 
        health-care provider about exercise during pregnancy. Continue eating 
        a variety of foods to make sure that you are getting adequate energy, 
        protein, vitamins and minerals.
