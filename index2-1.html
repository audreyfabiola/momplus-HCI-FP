      Congratulations – you’re about to be a mother! Becoming a parent is an exciting and 
      rewarding experience, but it can also feel overwhelming at times and you likely have 
      lots of questions. That’s to be expected and we hope this guide will be a useful companion 
      throughout your pregnancy. During the first 13 week of pregnancy, your body is growing and 
      changing, and so is your baby’s. Here’s what to know as you start this amazing journey together.</div>
    <div class="text">
      <br><br>
      <h2>How You're feeling</h2>
      Your body is about to undergo some major changes as it prepares to grow a new life.
      You may start to experience symptoms such as nausea or fatigue – or you may find that 
      you have an increased level of energy! Listen to your body and make adjustments to your 
      routines as needed. Every woman is different, and so is each pregnancy.
      <br><br>
      <h2>Early Signs and Symptoms of Pregnancy</h2>
      The earliest sign of pregnancy is a missed period for women who have a regular monthly 
      menstrual cycle. Sometimes, implantation bleeding can occur. This is a bleed very 
      similar to a light period or spotting. Though this is completely normal, you should 
      check with your health-care provider if you experience any bleeding during your pregnancy.

      You may also begin experiencing a handful of the symptoms below early on in your 
      pregnancy such as fatigue, nausea or more frequent urination.
      <br><br>
      <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
      The changes in your hormones during your first weeks of pregnancy affect your whole body. 
      While no two pregnancies are the same, some symptoms you may experience during your first 
      trimester include:<br><br>

      <li>Breast tenderness</li>
      <li>Extreme changes in mood</li>
      <li>Nausea or vomiting (morning sickness)</li>
      <li>Frequent urination</li>
      <li>Weight gain or loss</li>
      <li>Extreme fatigue</li>
      <li>Headaches</li>
      <li>Heartburn</li>
      <li>Leg cramps</li>
      <li>Lower back and pelvic pain</li>
      <li>Cravings for certain foods</li>
      <li>New dislike of certain foods</li>
      <li>Constipation</li>
      <br>
      <h2>Self Care</h2>
      Symptoms in early pregnancy can be uncomfortable to say the least. For some relief, 
      give these tips a try after checking with your health care provider first. Remember, 
      choices should always be made based on your preferences and what is available to you.

      For nausea or vomiting, try ginger, chamomile, vitamin B6 and/or acupuncture.
      For leg cramps, try magnesium or calcium.
      For constipation, if dietary modifications suggested by your health-care provider 
      are not working, wheat bran or other fibre supplements can be used for relief.
      Healthy foods and regular exercise are important for your entire pregnancy. 
      Continue your daily physical activity for as long as you feel comfortable doing so. 
      The more active you are during pregnancy, the easier it will be for you to adapt to 
      your changing body. Make sure to nourish your and your baby’s growing bodies with 
      nutritious food. Make sure you are getting adequate energy, protein, vitamins and 
      minerals by eating a variety of healthy foods, including vegetables, meat, beans, nuts, 
      pasteurized dairy and fruit.
